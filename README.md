# Enterprise Active Directory Lab

*A complete, enterprise-style Windows domain environment for cybersecurity, system administration, and blue-team training.*

---

## Overview

This project is a fully functional **Active Directory enterprise lab** built using **VirtualBox**, **Windows Server**, and **Windows 11**.

The purpose of this lab is to simulate a real corporate environment used for:

- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Domain Controller administration
- Group Policy management
- Privilege & account lifecycle operations
- Blue-team monitoring and detection engineering
- Cybersecurity learning, homelab architecture, and skill development

This repo includes:

- PowerShell automation scripts
- User generation workflow
- Names list for bulk AD account creation
- Lab documentation and structure

## Lab Architecture

+------------------------------------------------+
| Enterprise Network |
+------------------------------------------------+
|
| Internal VirtualBox Network
|
| DC01 (Server) |
| - Domain Controller |
| - DNS Server |
| - Static IP: 172.16.0.1

|
|  Domain Join / User Auth
|

|   CLIENT01 (Win11) |
| - Domain-Joined PC |
| - DHCP (from host) |

### **Why this structure?**

This mirrors real-world enterprise AD deployments:

- The **Domain Controller** owns the authoritative DNS zone.
- The internal network is isolated from the internet for security.
- Clients authenticate and receive policies from the DC.
- Scripts automate identity creation just like IAM teams do in production.

## Network Configuration

### **Domain Controller (DC01)**

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows Server |
| NIC | Internal Network |
| IP | `172.16.0.1` |
| Subnet | `255.255.255.0` |
| Gateway | *(blank)* |
| DNS | `127.0.0.1` |

### **Client (Windows 11)**

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| NIC | Internal Network |
| IP | DHCP or static |
| DNS | `172.16.0.1` |
| Domain | `yourdomain.local` |

---

## PowerShell Automation

### **User Creation Script**

Located at:

This script:

- Reads names from `names.txt`
- Parses first/last names
- Generates usernames
- Sets default passwords
- Places users inside a dedicated OU
- Creates accounts at scale (10–10,000 accounts)

This simulates real IAM workflows used by:

- IT Operations
- Identity Governance teams
- Enterprise support engineers
- SOC analysts investigating identity misuse

## 📄 Files in This Repository

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Create_Users.ps1` | PowerShell script for automated user creation |
| `names.txt` | List of names imported by the script |
| `.gitignore` | Prevents system or temp files from being committed |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## Learning Objectives

By building this lab, you practice and demonstrate:

### **✔ Active Directory Fundamentals**

- OUs
- Users
- Groups
- Authentication
- Group Policy

### **✔ Windows Server Administration**

- DNS
- Static networking
- Role installation
- Security hardening

### **✔ Infrastructure Architecture**

- Enterprise-style network isolation
